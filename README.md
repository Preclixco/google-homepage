# Google Homepage

In this repository, you will find the code and materials used for recreating a responsive Google homepage. This project was undertaken in an effort to put the theoretical skills of HTML and CSS to the test. The completion of such a project requires a grasp of containers, layouts, developer tools (in browsers), flexbox and more.

## Skills demonstrated

In completing this project, the following skills were utilised:

1. Using web browser dev tools to extract information, such as color codes and padding/margin, from exisiting sites
2. Creating a fulfilling HTML structure with head (including meta tags, links to CSS resets, CSS stylesheet, page title and favicons) and body (including the use of nav, footer and div)
3. Using BEM to aid keeping track of created CSS classes and avoiding unnecessary repetition
4. Using CSS flexbox, position, height, width and max-height/max-width to layout the structure of a webpage, whilst retaining responsiveness
5. Handling margins, padding, color, text-size and many other CSS attributes to create visually appealing sites
6. Creating media queries to more efficiently scale webpages over several devices

## Experience working on the project

I completely scrapped and restarted this project twice over, because of unclean and confusing HTML structures that led to difficulties with applying flexbox to layout the webpage. However, after several attempts, I am now very satisfied with the end result and the experience gained by putting the theory to work in practice
